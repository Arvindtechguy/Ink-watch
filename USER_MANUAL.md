## Tips and Tricks

### Battery Life
- E-ink displays consume almost no power when static
- Clock updates once per minute to save power
- Turn off watch when not in use
- Games consume more power due to frequent updates

### Best Practices
- Let display fully refresh to avoid ghosting
- Avoid rapid button presses (debouncing built-in)
- Set correct time after battery replacement
- Keep firmware updated

### Display Care
- E-ink displays are fragile - handle with care
- Avoid pressing directly on the screen
- Keep away from extreme temperatures
- Don't bend or flex the display

## Customization

You can customize the watch by editing the source code:

### Change Update Intervals
Edit `config.h`:
- `CLOCK_UPDATE_INTERVAL` - How often clock updates (default: 60 seconds)
- `GAME_UPDATE_INTERVAL` - Game speed (default: 200ms)

### Modify Game Difficulty
Edit `games.cpp`:
- Snake speed: Adjust `GAME_UPDATE_INTERVAL`
- Pong ball speed: Modify `ballDX` and `ballDY` initial values
- Snake length limit: Change `SNAKE_MAX_LENGTH` in config.h

### Add New Features
The modular code structure makes it easy to add:
- New games
- Stopwatch/timer
- Alarm functionality
- Step counter (with accelerometer)
- Temperature display (with sensor)

## Troubleshooting

**Display not updating**:
- Check battery level
- Verify display connections
- Reset the watch

**Time is wrong**:
- Time resets when power is lost
- Install RTC battery (CR2032)
- Set time in Settings (future feature)

**Buttons not working**:
- Check button connections
- Verify pull-up resistors are enabled
- Clean button contacts

**Games too fast/slow**:
- Adjust `GAME_UPDATE_INTERVAL` in config.h
- Re-upload sketch after changes

## Technical Specifications

- **Display**: E-ink, 128x250 pixels (configurable)
- **Processor**: ATmega328P @ 16MHz (Arduino Nano/Uno)
- **Power**: 3.7V LiPo battery
- **Battery Life**: Several days to weeks (depending on usage)
- **Update Rate**: 
  - Clock: 1 minute
  - Games: ~5 FPS
- **Memory**: 
  - Flash: 32KB (program)
  - SRAM: 2KB (variables)
  - EEPROM: 1KB (settings storage - future use)
